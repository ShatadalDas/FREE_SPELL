A VPN, which stands for virtual private network, establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet. This ensures that your online experiences are private, protected, and more secure.

## Don't use so called "Free VPNs"

- Often they sell your data to third party websites and corporations

- They are less secure in terms of hiding IP

## Best paid VPN's to use
- [Surfshark](https://surfshark.com/)
- [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/)

> If you just need to hide your IP while browsing then use [TOR Browser](https://www.torproject.org/).

> **Note: searching in tor can be slow as it works differently under the hood, then the VPN**
